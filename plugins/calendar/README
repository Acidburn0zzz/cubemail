A calendar module for Roundcube
-------------------------------

This plugin currently supports a local database as well as a Kolab groupware
server as backends for calendar and event storage. For both drivers, some
initialization of the local database is necessary. To do so, execute the
SQL commands in drivers/<yourchoice>/SQL/<yourdatabase>.initial.sql

The client-side calendar UI relies on the "fullcalendar" project by Adam Arshaw
with extensions made for the use in Roundcube. All changes are published in
an official fork at https://github.com/roundcube/fullcalendar

For recurring event computation, some utility classes from the Horde project
are used. They are packaged in a slightly modified version with this plugin.

iCalendar parsing is done with the help of the Horde_iCalendar class. A copy
of that class with all its dependencies is part of this package. In order
to update it, execute lib/get_horde_icalendar.sh > lib/Horde_iCalendar.php
Finally apply the patch lib/Horde_iCalendar_timezone.diff to fix timezone
handling when parsing iCal files.

IMPORTANT
---------
The calendar module makes heavy use of PHP's DateTime as well as DateInterval
classes. The latter one requires at least PHP 5.3.0 to run.
