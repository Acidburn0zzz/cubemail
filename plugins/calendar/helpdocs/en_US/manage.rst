Manage Your Schedule
====================

All functions to maintain your events are accessible from the main calendar view.


Add Events to a Calendar
------------------------

**Via toolbar** 
    Click the *New event* button in the toolbar to get an empty dialog where you enter
    the event properties such as summary, date/time, reminders, etc. Click *Save* to finally
    add it to the selected calendar.

**At a specific date/time**
    Navigate the calendar view to the date you want to add an event for. Then mark the range
    of time (or dates in month view) with the mouse by pressing the button at the time the event
    should start and releasing it again at time it finishes. This will open the event dialog
    with the selected time/date range already filled it.

    In order to create new all-day events, double-click the desired day in the calendar view.

Edit and Reschedule Events
--------------------------

The Event Dialog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When clicking an event in the calendar view, a dialog showing its details is displayed.
Clicking the *Edit* button in that dialog opens the form to edit all properties of the selected event.

The edit form is divided into different section which can be switched using the tabs on top
of the dialog.

**Summary**

This general section has text fields and selectors for various properties of an event.
This is where you adjust the displayed summary, date/time/duration as well as reminder
notifications and category assignments.

The *Calendar* selector allows you to move an event from one calendar to another.

**Recurrence**

For periodically recurring event series, this tabs has the settings how an event is repeated
over time. Start with selecting a repetition interval (e.g. monthly). Depending on that interval
the for below offers more options to further refine the rules how the event is repeated and for how long.

**Participants**

An important part of managing your schedule is to invite others to events and track their RSVP.
In this part of the edit dialog you can manage the participants of an event. Read more about this
further down in the :ref:`calendar-event-participants` section.

**Participants**

Sometimes a description text isn't enough to collect information for a specific event.
Switch to this tab to attach files to the current event or to remove them again. Adding
files works pretty much the same as :ref:`attaching them to email messages <mail-compose-attachments>`:
first select a file from your local disk and click *Upload* in order to attach it.

.. note:: Don't forget to finally save the changes by clicking *Save* in the event edit dialog.
    Even switching back and forth the tabs will not yet save the data.


Moving and Resizing with the Mouse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    If an existing event shall be rescheduled to another time or date, you'll find it handy
    to do that directly in the calendar view without opening the edit form. Simply grab the event
    block with the mouse and move it to the new date or time. Release the mouse button to complete.

    In *Month* and *Day* view, the event blocks have a small handle at the bottom. Drag this with the
    mouse in order to resize the event meaning to adjust its duration.
