Share Calendars
===============

For collaboration, sharing calendars is an important feature. In the :ref:`overview <calendar-lists>`,
we have already learned how calendars others share with you appear in the calendars list. The following
now explains how to make personal calendars accessible to fellow users.


Share a Calendar with others
----------------------------

Sharing is controlled through the :ref:`Calendar Settings Dialog <calendar-edit-properties>`.
Double-click a calendar in the list on the left and then select the *Sharing* tab at the top of
the dialog box:

The table displays who already has permission to see and modify the selected calendar.
In order to share the calendar with a new user

1. Click the + icon in the table footer
2. Select whether to grant permissions for a single user, all or guests
3. For individual users, enter the email address of the user into the text box.
   Possible candidates will be listed as you type. Choose one from the list and hit the <Tab> key to select it.
4. Check the individual access rights you want to grant to this user or group.
5. Click the *Save* of this inner popup box. This will add a new entry to the list.

Double-click an entry to edit the permissions for a particular user or group.

For removing existing permissions, select the according entry in the list and then choose
*Delete* from the menu behind the gear icon in the footer of the list.


Subscribe to Shared Calendars
-----------------------------

Calendars shared by others are not showing up right away in the list within the calendar view.
Switch to :ref:`Settings > Folders <settings-folders>` to see all resources you can access.
There's a shortcut to this: click *Manage folders* in the options menu behind the gear icon
located the footer of the calendars list.

In order to make a shared calendar appear in the calendars list, locate it in the folder manager
and check the *Subscribed* mark in the list. Only subscribed calendars are visible in the calendar view.
