Library providing common functions for calendar-based plugins
-------------------------------------------------------------

Provides utility functions for calendar-related modules such as

* alarms display and dismissal
* attachment handling
* iCal parsing and exporting

iCal parsing is done with the help of the Horde_iCalendar class. A copy
of that class with all its dependencies is part of this package. In order
to update it, execute lib/get_horde_icalendar.sh > lib/Horde_iCalendar.php
Finally apply the patch lib/Horde_iCalendar_timezone.diff to fix timezone
handling when parsing iCal files.
