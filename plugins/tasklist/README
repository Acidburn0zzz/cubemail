A task management module for Roundcube
--------------------------------------

This plugin currently supports a local database as well as a Kolab groupware
server as backends for tasklists and todo items storage.

INSTALLATION
------------

When usigng the database driver, some initialization of the local database is
necessary:

  cd ../../
  $ bin/initdb.sh --dir=plugins/tasklist/drivers/database/SQL


For some general calendar-based operations such as alarms handling, this
plugin requires the `libcalendaring` plugin, as well as libkolab plugin
for skins support, which are also part of the Kolab Roundcube Plugins
repository. Make sure these plugins are installed and configured correctly.

IMPORTANT
---------

This plugin doesn't work with the classic skin of Roundcube because no
templates are available for that skin.
